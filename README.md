# TENETS AND TERMS 

## The Zero Trust Model 
The concept that there should be zero trust with anything or anyone that is attempting to access the company’s network until they’re verified. In other words, never trust always verify. It is valuable because it further secures one’s network against internal and external threats by verifying anything and everything that has access to it.

Examples of some of the main principles behind Zero Trust are: Implementing access controls (like VPN, which is an information access control), MFA or multi factor authentication (which requires 2 or more methods of authentication to verify a user, 2 factor is the most common), and Least Privilege (giving users the least amount of access they need to accomplish tasks within their specific role).

## IEC 27001 & 27002 
Essentially an overview of everything a company must do to achieve compliance.

## ISO 27001
ISO 27001 is the central framework of the ISO 27000 series which is the Standard that contains the implementation requirements for an ISMS (Information Security Management System, a series of documents relating to various parts of information security management).

## ISO 27002
ISO 27002 is a supplementary standard that focuses on the information security controls that organizations might choose to implement.

## When you should use each standard
ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 have different objectives and will be helpful in different circumstances.

If you’re starting out with the Standard or are planning your ISMS implementation framework, then ISO 27001 is ideal. 

You should refer to ISO 27002 once you’ve identified the controls that you’ll be implementing to learn more about how each one works.

## What is the General Data Protection Regulation & Consumer Privacy Act?
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are laws that emerged to give individuals greater power over their personal information. 

Both regulate organizations that collect and use data in a variety of ways.

The GDPR does have implications for businesses in the United States, despite originating in Europe. 

## A brief summary of the CCPA
1. Gives California residents increased transparency and control over how businesses collect and use their data.
2. Generally applies to organizations doing business in California, and to those that handle or share the personal information of California residents

## A brief summary of the GDPR
1. To give European Union (E.U.) residents increased transparency and control over how businesses collect and use their data.
2. GDPR applies to organizations in and out of the E.U. that process the personal data of E.U. residents.

## Security Controls that need to be put in place so that General Data Protection Regulation can work for your business
The fundamental practices needed for compliance around a security and data privacy program are:

1. Identity and Access Management (IDAM or IAM), whose two key principles are, separation of duties and least privilege. They help ensure that employees have access  only to information or systems applicable to their job function.

2. A DLP (Data Loss Prevention) tool helps prevent the loss of personal data, which is critical in preventing a breach. DLP controls add a layer of protection by restricting the transmission of personal data outside the network.

3. Pseudonymization helps the organization meet its data protection obligations, particularly the principles of data minimization and storage limitation, and processing for research purposes for which ‘appropriate safeguards’ are required. It is defined within GDPR as the processing of personal data in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, as long as such additional information is kept separately and subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure non-attribution to an identified or identifiable individual.

4. A mature Incident Response Plan (IRP) addresses phases such as preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Under GDPR, in the event of a potential data breach that involves personal information, your organization would need to notify the Data Protection Authority without undue delay, within 72 hours if feasible, after becoming aware of the breach; and Communicate high-risk breaches to affected data subjects without undue delay.

5. Third-Party Risk Management, if an organization entrusts the processing of personal data to a processor or sub-processor, and a breach occurs, all are liable. GDPR data compliance also obligates processors to have an active role in the protection of personal data. Regardless of instructions fromthe controller, the processor of  personal data must follow GDPR and can be liable for any incidents associated with loss or unauthorized access to personal data. Sub-processors also will need to
comply with the GDPR based on each contractual relationship established between a processor and sub-processor.
 
6. Review Policies and Procedures and measure their effectiveness and maturity. (i.e., they may be outdated or just not work for your current posture and if not, draft new/revise current policies) Revision would be best, as if everyone isn’t on board because the change is too broad, and they don’t implement the processes as needed, a breach can occur. For best practices, organizational policy acknowledgment and training ensures policies are properly communicated and understood.

7. Create a plan that provides in-depth analysis of gaps in order to assess your company’s level of compliance of the information security management.

## NERC/ NERC CIP
The NERC is the federal entity responsible for the oversight of the Bulk Electric System (BES) for North America. Its jurisdiction applies to all owners, users, producers, and suppliers of the Bulk Electric Supply in eight provinces of Canada, one state in Mexico and all of the continental United States. NERC Standards carry the force of regulation and as such are mandatory for all entities to whom it applies, and they cover a wide range of categories. 

NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards are those which apply specifically to the cybersecurity aspects of the Bulk Electric System and its efficient and reliable supply. 

CIP deals with the prior planning and preparation within organizations and government agencies to deal with threats to the effective and timely functioning of national and regional critical infrastructure. 

## HIPAA - The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
HIPAA is United States legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. The law has emerged into greater prominence in recent years with the many health data breaches caused by cyber attacks and ransomware attacks on health insurers and providers. The federal law was signed by President Bill Clinton on Aug. 21, 1996. HIPAA overrides state laws regarding the safety of medical information, unless the state law is considered more stringent than HIPAA.

It's two main purposes are: 
1. To provide continuous health insurance coverage for workers who lose or change their job and to ultimately reduce the cost of healthcare by standardizing the electronic transmission of administrative and financial transactions. 
2. Other goals include combating abuse, fraud and waste in health insurance and healthcare delivery, and improving access to long-term care services and health insurance.

## HIPAA Privacy Rule 
Officially known as the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, this rule establishes national standards to protect patient health information.

## HIPAA Security Rule
The Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) sets standards for patient data security.

## HIPAA Enforcement Rule 
This rule establishes guidelines for investigations into HIPAA compliance violations.

## What should a risk profile include?
A risk profile should include:

The nature and level of the threats faced by an organization.

The likelihood of adverse effects occurring.

The level of disruption and costs associated with each type of risk.

The effectiveness of the controls in place to manage those risks.
